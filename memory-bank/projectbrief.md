# Dotfiles Project Brief

## Overview
This repository contains dotfiles and configuration files for system setup and customization across different environments (Linux, macOS, servers). It provides a structured approach to managing configuration files, shell scripts, and utilities that enhance the user experience and streamline workflow.

## Core Objectives
1. **Portability**: Maintain configurations that work across different systems and environments
2. **Modularity**: Organize configurations in a modular way to allow selective application
3. **Automation**: Automate setup and configuration processes to minimize manual steps
4. **Consistency**: Ensure consistent experience across different machines
5. **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation for setup and customization options

## Key Components
1. **Home Directory Configurations**: Shell configs (.zshrc, .bashrc), Git configs, terminal customizations
2. **System-Specific Configurations**: Files for different operating systems (Linux, macOS)
3. **Scripts**: Utility scripts for automation and common tasks
4. **Box**: Environment-specific setup scripts and package lists
5. **Profiles**: User-specific configurations for different contexts (personal, work)
6. **Bin Directory**: Custom executables and utility scripts

## Project Scope
- Manage dotfiles across multiple systems with different operating systems
- Provide automated installation and update mechanisms
- Support different profiles for various use contexts
- Maintain security by separating sensitive information
- Enable easy synchronization between systems
