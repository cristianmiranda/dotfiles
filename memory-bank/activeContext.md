# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Initial setup of the memory bank for the dotfiles repository
- Understanding and documenting the structure and purpose of the dotfiles
- Establishing a foundation for future enhancements and maintenance

## Recent Changes
- Created memory bank with core documentation files:
  - projectbrief.md: Core project definition and scope
  - productContext.md: Problem space and functional requirements
  - systemPatterns.md: Architecture and design patterns
  - techContext.md: Technologies and technical details

## Next Steps
- Review the dotfiles structure in more depth
- Document specific patterns and customizations in key configuration files
- Identify potential areas for improvement or consolidation
- Establish a process for testing changes across different environments

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Documentation Approach**: Focusing on the core structure and patterns first before diving into specific configuration details
- **Scope Management**: Determining which aspects of the dotfiles to prioritize for documentation and potential enhancements
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Ensuring changes work across both macOS and Linux environments
- **Security**: Maintaining the separation of sensitive information in .secret files

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **Modular Organization**: Files are organized by function and environment
- **Selective Loading**: Configuration files are loaded based on context (work, personal, etc.)
- **Encapsulation**: Related configurations are grouped together
- **Environment Detection**: Scripts and configurations adapt to the detected environment
- **Secret Management**: Sensitive information is kept in separate .secret files

## Learnings and Project Insights
- The repository uses a mix of direct configuration files and scripts to automate configuration
- There's a clear separation between system-specific and cross-platform configurations
- Multiple profiles allow for context-specific customizations
- Docker configurations suggest containerized development environments
- Extensive collection of custom scripts in bin/ directory indicates a focus on workflow automation
