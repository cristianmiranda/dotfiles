# Product Context

## Purpose
The dotfiles repository serves as a centralized management system for configuration files and scripts that customize and enhance the user experience across different computing environments. It addresses the common problem of maintaining consistent configurations, automating repetitive setup tasks, and preserving customizations when switching between machines or rebuilding systems.

## Problems Solved
1. **Configuration Fragmentation**: Consolidates scattered configuration files into a version-controlled repository
2. **System Setup Inefficiency**: Reduces time and effort required to configure a new system
3. **Configuration Inconsistency**: Ensures consistent experience across different machines
4. **Knowledge Loss**: Preserves specialized configurations and customizations that might otherwise be lost
5. **Adaptation Difficulty**: Makes it easier to adapt to different environments (work, personal, server)

## Functional Requirements
1. **Configuration Management**: Store and organize dotfiles in a logical structure
2. **Installation Automation**: Provide scripts to install and link configurations
3. **Environment Detection**: Adapt to different operating systems and environments
4. **Profile Support**: Allow different configurations for different use contexts
5. **Security Management**: Handle sensitive information securely
6. **Modularity**: Allow selective application of configurations

## User Experience Goals
1. **Simplicity**: Make setup and synchronization as simple as possible
2. **Transparency**: Make it clear what configurations are being applied
3. **Control**: Provide fine-grained control over what gets installed
4. **Reliability**: Ensure configurations work as expected in different environments
5. **Extensibility**: Allow easy addition of new configurations and scripts

## Key Workflows
1. **Initial Setup**: Bootstrap a new system with core configurations
2. **Configuration Updates**: Easily update and synchronize configurations
3. **Environment Switching**: Adapt configurations for different environments
4. **Customization**: Extend and customize for specific needs
5. **Security Management**: Safely handle sensitive information
