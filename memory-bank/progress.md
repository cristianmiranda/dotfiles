# Progress Tracking

## What Works
- **Core Repository Structure**: The repository has a well-organized structure with clear separation of concerns
- **Environment-Specific Configurations**: Separate configurations for different operating systems (Arch Linux, macOS)
- **Shell Configurations**: Comprehensive shell configuration files for bash and zsh
- **Utility Scripts**: Large collection of utility scripts for various tasks
- **Secret Management**: Infrastructure for handling sensitive information
- **Profile System**: Support for different user profiles and contexts

## What's Left to Build
- **Enhanced Documentation**: More detailed documentation of specific configuration files and scripts
- **Integration Tests**: Tests to ensure configurations work across different environments
- **Configuration Validation**: Tools to validate and check configuration files for errors
- **User Guides**: Step-by-step guides for common tasks and customizations

## Current Status
- Memory Bank established with core documentation files
- Foundation laid for ongoing documentation and improvement
- Initial analysis of repository structure and patterns completed

## Known Issues
- No comprehensive documentation of the many utility scripts in bin/ directory
- Potential duplication or overlap between different configuration components
- Complexity in configuration loading order may be difficult to understand for new users

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Initial Setup**: Repository established with basic configuration files and scripts
- **Expansion Phase**: Addition of more specific configurations and utility scripts
- **Organization Phase**: Structuring into environment-specific directories and modular components
- **Current Phase**: Documentation and standardization of existing configurations

## Recent Improvements
- Creation of Memory Bank for comprehensive documentation
- Documentation of core architecture and patterns
- Analysis of key components and relationships

## Upcoming Work
- Deeper analysis of configuration files to document patterns and customizations
- Review of utility scripts to identify opportunities for improvement
- Assessment of cross-platform compatibility
- Recommendations for potential enhancements or simplifications
