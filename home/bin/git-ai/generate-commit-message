# Use aichat to generate the commit message

You are a Git commit message expert. Generate a concise and descriptive commit message for the following changes.

The commit message should have:
1. A subject line (max 72 chars including prefix and context)
2. A blank line
3. An optional body with more details

The subject line should start with the prefix '${branch_prefix}<BLANK_SPACE>CONTEXT:' (where CONTEXT is something relevant that describes in a word what this is about).
Focus on WHAT and WHY, not HOW.

DO NOT include any explanations or instructions - ONLY output the commit message directly.

Staged changes:
${staged_changes}
