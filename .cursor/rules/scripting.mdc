# Scripting Standards

When writing or modifying scripts:

- Always include error handling and checks
- Provide clear logging with color coding when appropriate
- Make scripts idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
- Add platform detection for cross-platform compatibility
- Use variables for paths and configuration options
- Include usage instructions in comments at the top of each script

@scripts/deploy.sh
@scripts/install.sh
