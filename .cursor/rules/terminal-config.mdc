# Terminal Configuration Standards

When working with terminal emulator configurations:

- Use consistent color schemes across terminals
- Configure font settings that work across platforms
- Set sensible clipboard integration options
- Consider both readability and aesthetics
- Configure appropriate key bindings that don't conflict with shell/applications
