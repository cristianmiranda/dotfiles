# Shell Configuration Standards

When working with shell configuration files:

- Use comments to explain non-obvious configurations
- Group related configurations together
- Prefer environment variables for system-dependent settings
- Check for the existence of tools before configuring them
- Use conditional loading for platform-specific settings

@home/.zshrc
@home/.bashrc
