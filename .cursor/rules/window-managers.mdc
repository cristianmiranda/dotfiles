# Window Manager Configuration Standards

When modifying window manager configurations:

- Use descriptive names for workspaces and keybindings
- Document all custom keybindings in comments
- Separate application startup from window manager configuration
- Use variables for colors and repeated values
- Maintain consistent styling across all UI elements

@home/.config/polybar/config.ini
